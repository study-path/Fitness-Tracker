# Fitness-Tracker
This is the Fitness Tracker app. Which is a study's project with an entire angular app from scratch. It features users sign up where we specify e-mail password our birth date feature by a date picker and then of course also have to agree to the terms and conditions. And then we can log in and start exercises we choose from a set of exercises that's actually fetched from the server we started. We can cancel it if we want and we can of course do all the past exercises and we can even falter and sorties. That's a lot of cool features combined.
